            Luminara, the twilight world of Galaxy Gardens, bathes in eternal dusk, thanks to its distant position from the sun. 
            This land features natural wonders like sparkling crystals and deep bodies of water. Two ancient tribes, the Solari and the Noctari, 
            dwell here, guardians of light and mystics of shadow respectively. They normally uphold the balance between light and darkness, 
            but their precious Eclipse Pearl artifact has gone missing, causing the factions to fight. Immerse yourself in the enchantment of Luminara, where every corner 
            offers a story, by discovering various "scanning pads" throughout the map to unlock the characters of the land. And, if you go looking for more at the real-life locations of the
            locations on the map, who knows what additional secrets you may uncover!
