            Dear Atlas,
        </p>
        <p>
            Under the eternal twilight that bathes our world, I find myself writing this letter with a heavy heart, yet filled with a hope that the starlit sky seems to whisper possible. The constant glow of our Lumina Crystal casts long shadows, and in them, I see the depth of the division that has estranged our peoples for too long.
        </p>
        <p>
            As leader of the Solari, my duty has always been to protect the light that nurtures Luminara. Yet, in this duty, I have come to recognize that light cannot exist without the shadow, and that perhaps our interpretation of 'protection' has led us astray from the true path to peace.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Eclipse Pearl—its absence has been a source of strife, suspicion, and sorrow between us. It is a symbol of balance, one that neither light can claim nor shadow forsake without losing the essence of what makes Luminara truly magnificent. In my heart, I know that neither of our hands guided its disappearance, yet our reactions have only fueled the fires of discord.
        </p>
        <p>
            I write to you now not as a leader to her counterpart, but as one guardian of our world to another, proposing that we seek the Eclipse Pearl together. Imagine the strength and unity it could restore between our peoples; the light and shadow no longer at war but in harmony. We could lead Luminara not into further division, but into an era where balance is not just a legend from our past, but a reality.
        </p>
        <p>
            I confess, I am reluctant to voice these thoughts aloud; not out of pride, but out of fear. Fear that my own people may see this as a weakness, or that your interpretation might mirror theirs. Yet, I trust in the wisdom that your connection to the Umbra Stone has bestowed upon you, and in the visions that guide you towards the truth as much as they do lead us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let us meet at the boundary of the Radiant Spires and the Shaded Veil—where light meets shadow. Let us speak as allies, not adversaries. Our search for the Eclipse Pearl could be the bridge that mends centuries of broken trust.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the spirit of peace and with the sincerest hope for our unified future,
        </p>
        <p>
            Estella
        </p>
